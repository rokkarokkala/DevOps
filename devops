   This Git command will get all the updates from the remote repository, including new branches.

2. git checkouts
   You can use the checkout command to switch the branch that you are currently working on.
  
   * git checkout <branch name>

3.git init
  This is the command you need to use if you want to start a new empty repository or to reinitialize an existing one in the project root. It will create a .git directory with its subdirectories. It should look like this:

   *git init <repository name>

4. git diff
   You can use this command to see the unstaged changes on the current branch. Hereâ€™s an example of a branch with an edited feature file:

5. git pull
    Using git pull will fetch all the changes from the remote repository and merge any remote changes in the current local branch.
